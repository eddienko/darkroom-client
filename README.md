   This will securely store your credentials and kubeconfig in
   `~/.darkroom/config.yaml.enc`.

   ```bash
   darkroom job submit test-job \
     --image docker.io/6darkroom/jh-darkroom:latest \
     --script "echo hello && sleep 60" \
     --cpu 1 --memory 1Gi
   ```

3. **List jobs**:

   ```bash
   darkroom job list
   ```

4. **Use storage** (S3 backend):

   ```bash
   darkroom storage ls        # list buckets
   darkroom storage ls mybucket/  # list objects
   ```
